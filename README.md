# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project we will uncover trends btween goals, launch dates, and total projects of kickstarters of theater and plays.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to find the best time to launch a kickstarter and what would be the best goal in order to have the best chance of succeeding.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
After reviewing "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Dates" chart you can see that the best month to launch a kickstarter for theater is the month of May and the worse month is December. May launched theater kickstarters are twice as likly to succeed than to fail while December launched kickstarters have a nearly 50/50 chance of succeeding vs failing.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
At first glance when reviewing the "Play Outcomes Based on Goal" chart you can see that plays with a goals less than $20,000 and goals between $35,000 to $45,000 are more likley to succeed. However, after reviewing the total amount of projects there are only a total of 20 projects that had goals in that range. With such a small sample size you can not confirm wheater or not this goal range outcomes is consitanly more likly to succeed. On the other hand kicksterters with goals less than $20,000 have a total of 985 projects with more succededing than failing, also the highest successful kickstarters were those with goals less than $1,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I hade difficulties in Deliverable 1 with getting the rows in the pivot tabel to be months instead of years. First I had to figure out what data to place in columns, rows, and values then once the pivot tabel look like how I needed it I did some googlefu to figure out how to group the rows. Another difficulty I had was with getting the "Play Outcomes Based on Goal" line chart to have percentages on the vertical axis. I did some research and looked at the hints provided to get me starterd but it didn't solve all my problems. Only after messing wth the format axis window did I get more familiar with how to manipulate the chart and was able to set the correct perecent perameter for the vertival axis.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
You can conclude that May is the best month to launch a theater kickstarter while December is the worst month. Also you can conclude that on average theater outcomes are more likley to succeed than fail on any given month.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From Outcomes based on Goals you can conclude that Play kickstaters with goals less than $20,000 are more likely to succeed.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation I found with this dataset is the uneven distribution of the amount of projects in different goal ranges.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A possible graph would be a bar graph of the total projects vs goal to show this distribution.
